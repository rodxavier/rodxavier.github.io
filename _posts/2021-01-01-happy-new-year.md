Hello World! I'm Rod. I'm a husband, a dad, and a developer.

2020 was tough. If I'll choose a word representative of the year, I would choose `isolation`. As someone who prefers to keep things to myself, 2020 was the year when I felt
the most isolated. It felt like I was a sponge absorbing every drop of what the year has to offer, all the while being unable to squeeze off any of the load.

So, I decided I'll start blogging again so I can take a squeeze nice and slow every once in a while.
